<!-- I'm currently working at Capgemini as a Software Engineer. I build serverless microservices with AWS CDK, Lambda, and DynamoDB. I also build features in our Next.js app, and help maintain our PHP server.
On my free time, I love playing with Javascript and TypeScript to build open source projects. All the big ones are listed above! These projects usually involve React, React Native, Actix Web, and Docker.
I'm learning Svelte. It's very fun because it compiles down to simple javascript, and gracefully supports progressive enhancement.
When I'm not programming, I am usually cooking (vegan), playing (World of Warcraft, Rimworld, Ultrakill), riding my bicycle, or spending time with my dogs.
I graduated from The Ohio State University with an MS in Computer Science. You can find my publications online.
